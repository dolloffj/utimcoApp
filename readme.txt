I created a basic .NET Core  console app that consumes some methods and models stored in a .NET standard libary, along with a unit testing project.

I chose .NET core because it was simple and is platform agnostic, as opposed to a web app or other potentially less portable solution.

It seemed like the most straighforward way to provide a solution with unit tests that a user with Visual studio could build and then run.

There are instructions provided to the user within the console app, along with some basic error/exception handling to allow for retries.

If there seems to be anything missing from the repo, please contact me at dolloffj@gmail.com
